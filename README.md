# Auto Commit Master Extension

The Auto Commit Master extension for Visual Studio Code automates the process of committing changes to Git repositories. Instead of manually committing each file, this extension automatically adds and commits files with appropriate commit messages.

The Auto Commit Master extension offers the following features:

-  Automatic Committing: The extension automatically adds and commits new files to the Git repository. It eliminates the need for manual committing of individual files.

-  Commit Message Generation: The extension generates commit messages for each file based on its name and status. It prefixes the commit message with either `Add` or `Update` to indicate whether the file is new or modified, respectively.

-  Deletion Handling: If a file is deleted, the extension detects it and creates a commit with a `Delete` message.

-  Stop Functionality: The extension provides a stop command that allows users to halt the automatic commit process.

# Usage
